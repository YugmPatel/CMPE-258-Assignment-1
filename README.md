# CMPE-258-Assignment-1

# Assignment Overview

This assignment involves utilizing various AI and development tools to generate creative and technical outputs, including image generation, text processing, full-stack development, and neural network implementation. The completed work should be documented and made available on GitHub, with video walkthroughs for key components.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Image Generation with Deepseek Janus
- Use **Deepseek Janus** to create visually interesting images based on prompts.
- Provide an engaging image as input and generate insightful information based on it.
- Reference: [Janus Pro Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/janus-pro)
- Output: Store results in **Google Colab** and check in to GitHub.

### 2. Text Processing with Deepseek R1
- Use **Deepseek R1** for interesting text-to-text conversation generation.
- Reference: [Deepseek R1 Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/deepseek-r1)
- Output: Include generated conversations in Colab and check them into GitHub.

### 3. Full-Stack Development with Bolt.diy
- Use **Bolt.diy** to build a unique full-stack application.
- Provide a **video walkthrough** of the final app demo.
- Store all code artifacts in **GitHub**.

### 4. Neural Network for MNIST Classification using Cursor
- Use **Cursor** to generate a neural network model for MNIST classification using **Keras**.
- Implement all necessary supporting metrics as shown in class.
- Provide a **YouTube video walkthrough** of the process and code.

### 5. Local Full-Stack Development with Roo Code & Aider
- Use **Roo Code** and **Aider** to create a simple full-stack application locally.
- Reference: [Aider Tutorial](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/tutorials.html) and [Aider Examples](https://aider.chat/examples/README.html)
- Store all related code in **GitHub**.

## Deliverables
- **Colab Notebooks** for Deepseek Janus and Deepseek R1 outputs.
- **GitHub Repository** containing all project artifacts.
- **Video Walkthroughs** for the Bolt.diy app and Cursor MNIST classifier.
- **Full-Stack App Code** using Roo Code & Aider checked into GitHub.

## Submission
- Ensure all materials (code, notebooks, videos, and documentation) are properly organized in GitHub.
- Include necessary explanations and comments in the code.
- Provide working links to YouTube walkthroughs.
